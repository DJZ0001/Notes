Uncategorized quotes:
- All religion (those honest and earnest) seek to find truth. Thus, objective truth, it itself, is its own religion (science is not objective truth, merely just a truth seeking process by repetition)
- Human psychology has set it up so that people assume bad experiences or the one percent of differnerning expectations of the norm to be the norm.
