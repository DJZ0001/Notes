## Epigraphs
> "Sa-a-a-ay." It's just occurred to him. "What are all you folks helping me like this? For free and all?"
>
> "Who knows? We have to play the patterns. There must be a pattern you're in, right now."

— *Gravity's Rainbow*, Thomas Pynchon

> There's no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley

— *Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*, Peter Thiel with Blake Masters

## Uncategorized quotes:
- All religion (those honest and earnest) seek to find truth. Thus, objective truth, in itself, is its own religion (but, science is not objective truth, merely just an imperfect truth seeking process by repetition)
- Human psychology has set it up so that people assume bad experiences or the one percent of differnerning expectations of the norm to be the norm.
- There is objective beauty in art. Art can also be laden in the eyes of the beholder. These are not mutually exclusive.
- Everything a person does is a revelation of themselves.
- Self awareness is not the same as capacity for change
- We may live in chaos, but there are mechanisms of control
- There are no such things as walls, only barriers

## Zero to one
Quotes and individual notes from *Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*, Peter Thiel with Blake Masters. All credit to them.
> Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.

> Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today. What happens when we’ve gained everything to be had from fine-tuning the old lines of business that we’ve inherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the answer threatens to be far worse than the crisis of 2008. Today’s “best practices” lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.

> Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams or honeycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them.

> Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.
 
> the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing nations implies that the “developed” world has   already achieved the achievable, and that poorer nations just need to catch up.

> In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).

> The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.

> All companies must be "lean", which is code for "unplanned."... and yet the opposite principle is probably more correct: A bad plan is better than no plan.

> That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can’t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

> if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

> In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything.

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking.

> Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.

> Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.

> Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.

> it takes time to build valuable things

> But moving first is a tactic, not a goal

> Ralph Waldo Emerson captured this ethos when he wrote: “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.... Strong men believe in cause and effect.”

> When we debate historical questions like these, luck is in the past tense. Far more important are questions about the future: is it a matter of chance or design?

> A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many- sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.

> The European Central Bank doesn’t stand for anything but improvisation: the U.S. Treasury prints “In God We Trust” on the dollar; the ECB might as well print “Kick the Can Down the Road” on the euro. Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things don’t get worse... All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe’s famous vacation mania.

> big plans for the future have become archaic curiosities.

> Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange already-invented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations.

> The government used to be able to coordinate complex solutions to problems like atomic weaponry and lunar exploration. But today, after 40 years of indefinite creep, the government mainly just provides insurance

> In philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.

> But leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find the global maximum.

> definite founders with robust plans don’t sell, which means the offer wasn’t high enough. When Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought we should at least consider it. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the board meeting and announced: “Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.” Mark saw where he could take the company, and Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.

> You are not a lottery ticket.

> Most sayings are forgotten. At the other extreme, a select few people like Einstein and Shakespeare are constantly quoted and ventriloquized. We shouldn’t be surprised, since small minorities often achieve disproportionate results.

> everybody is an investor

> It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

> People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong.

> Fourth is “flatness.” As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” Given that assumption, anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique.

> You can't find secrets without looking for them... If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth. The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. There is more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and in technology of all kinds. We are within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today’s conventional disciplines, but of ambitions so great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution hesitated to announce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and metabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world from conflict over fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers. But we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look.
