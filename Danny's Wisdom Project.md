Uncategorized quotes:
- All religion (those honest and earnest) seek to find truth. Thus, objective truth, it itself, its own religion (but, science is not objective truth, merely just an imperfect truth seeking process by repetition)
- Human psychology has set it up so that people assume bad experiences or the one percent of differnerning expectations of the norm to be the norm.
