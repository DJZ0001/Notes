## Epigraphs
> "Sa-a-a-ay." It's just occurred to him. "What are all you folks helping me like this? For free and all?"

> "Who knows? We have to play the patterns. There must be a pattern you're in, right now."

## Uncategorized quotes:
- All religion (those honest and earnest) seek to find truth. Thus, objective truth, in itself, is its own religion (but, science is not objective truth, merely just an imperfect truth seeking process by repetition)
- Human psychology has set it up so that people assume bad experiences or the one percent of differnerning expectations of the norm to be the norm.
- There is objective beauty in art. Art can also be laden in the eyes of the beholder. These are not mutually exclusive.
- Everything a person does is a revelation of themselves.
- Self awareness is not the same as capacity for change
