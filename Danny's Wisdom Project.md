## Epigraphs
> "Sa-a-a-ay." It's just occurred to him. "What are all you folks helping me like this? For free and all?"
>
> "Who knows? We have to play the patterns. There must be a pattern you're in, right now."

— *Gravity's Rainbow*, Thomas Pynchon

> There's no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley

— *Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*, Peter Thiel with Blake Masters

## Uncategorized quotes:
- All religion (those honest and earnest) seek to find truth. Thus, objective truth, in itself, is its own religion (but, science is not objective truth, merely just an imperfect truth seeking process by repetition)
- Human psychology has set it up so that people assume bad experiences or the one percent of differnerning expectations of the norm to be the norm.
- There is objective beauty in art. Art can also be laden in the eyes of the beholder. These are not mutually exclusive.
- Everything a person does is a revelation of themselves.
- Self awareness is not the same as capacity for change
- We may live in chaos, but there are mechanisms of control
- There are no such things as walls, only barriers

## Zero to one
Quotes and individual notes from *Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*, Peter Thiel with Blake Masters. All credit to them.
> Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.

> Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today. What happens when we’ve gained everything to be had from fine-tuning the old lines of business that we’ve inherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the answer threatens to be far worse than the crisis of 2008. Today’s “best practices” lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.

> Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams or honeycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them.

> Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.
 
> the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing nations implies that the “developed” world has   already achieved the achievable, and that poorer nations just need to catch up.

> In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).

> The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.

> All companies must be "lean", which is code for "unplanned."... and yet the opposite principle is probably more correct: A bad plan is better than no plan.

> That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can’t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

> if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

> In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything.

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking.

> Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.

> Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.

> Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.

> it takes time to build valuable things
